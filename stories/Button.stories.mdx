import { Meta, Story, Canvas } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'
import Button from './Button'

<Meta title="Documentation/Input/Button" component={Button} />

The Button component is a very simple component to be used when we need
the user to send an event.

<Canvas>
  <Button>CLICK ME</Button>
</Canvas>
