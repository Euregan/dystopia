A Card is a simple container component to organize content in visual boxes.
The simplest card simply display its content.

<Canvas>
  <Card>
    Some nice content
    <br />
    You really can put anything in there
  </Card>
</Canvas>

You can also specify a title to cards if they're in dire need for an identity

<Canvas>
  <Card title="Now with a sweet title">
    Some nice content
    <br />
    You really can put anything in there
  </Card>
</Canvas>

If you really need to add some flair to a card, simply pass it an hex color.

<Canvas>
  <Card title="Now with a sweet title and some color" color="#ae1c13">
    Some nice content
    <br />
    You really can put anything in there
  </Card>
</Canvas>
