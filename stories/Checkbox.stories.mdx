import { Meta, Story, Canvas } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'
import Checkbox from './Checkbox'

<Meta title="Documentation/Input/Checkbox" component={Checkbox} />

A Checkbox component is pretty much what you expect.

<Canvas>
  <Checkbox />
</Canvas>

You can also give it a `label` to help the user understand what it does.

<Canvas>
  <Checkbox label="This is the best checkbox you'll see around" />
</Canvas>
